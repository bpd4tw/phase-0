##What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I thoroughly enjoyed this exercise. It was great going from learning and listening to all the different capabilities of HTML to applying the code for display. I found it a bit hard at first remembering the different syntaxes of each tag and attribute, but I eventually caught on a found my stride.  Self closing tags like "src" tripped me up once or twice when used with with the "a" tag.

##How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I found researching semantic HTML5 elements a big difficult at first, but steadily gained ground on understanding the elements and their usage. I read how HTML5 elements reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define their presentation or look. I found that if I wanted to better describe the use for a certain sizing element, semantic HTML5 provides the best tools now for doing so.  Instead of simply using <div> to define a space in HTML, we used <section> to better clarify the space and what text will be entered there.

##How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think we did a solid job of keeping best practices during this challenge.  We remembered opening tags and meta data like <!DOCTYPE html> and <html>, but struggled with the smaller details at times (i.e always closing tags, properly closing attributes). The HTML validation website was a great tool for double checking our work.

##What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is great in the fact that it allows any sort of text to be "marked up." A simple reference can turn into a link, or an average site can be spruced up with an <img> tag.  Also, HTML5 now allows sites to embed video and audio, high quality drawings and animations without using any plugins. The downside to HTML(specifically HTML5) is that older browsers will struggle to support the language, causing concern for internet users with older software.

##What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I don't know if I have any specific tricks for remembering HTML. It's like anything you want ot learn: it's more about practice and implementation than sheer memorization.  Code Academy is great because it allows you to practice a lesson immediately after learning some new code. I also try to review my HTML & CSS book by Jon Duckett frequently while doing these HTML challenges.

##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases of Web Design are (1)gathering information, (2)planning, (3)design, (4)development, (5)testing and delivery and (6)maintenance. Gathering information involves deciding on a target audience and figuring out goals. Planning usually involves the development of a site map. Design may incude prototypes such as A&B testing. Development occurs when the actual code is written. Testing and delivery is a step performed to ensure the website works across the myriad of browsers and operating systems present today. Lastly, maintenance involves regular checkups and recoding when bugs arise.

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The primary goal of my site is to showcase my past work history/accomplishments and provide a glimpse into the future, particularly in regards to future employment. After a person visits my site, they should have a solid grasp of my future career goals and the additions I can bring to their team. As a result, my site will feature my blog, resume, list of past accomplishments, links to social newtworks, projects I'm currently working, an "about me" section and my picture.

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience's interests will revolve around the professional world of technology. Hence, I'll have to make sure my site is not only laid out in a succinct and orderly manner, but is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye. No one wants to hire a developer whose code is sloppy. If my site isn't looking sharp, that'll be a dead giveaway that my coding game isn't up to snuff.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
My goals is that the site visitors will first look to examine my portfolio and then move to contact me. For potential employers, I'll need a nicely laid out resume/accomplishments page. For casual observors, my goals will slightly change: I'll want to direct them towards my social networking links.

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
When it comes to design, people should recognize the importance of planning. Taking time to sit down and map out what the goals of a site are, who the target audience is, what the site is being built to accomplish and how goals will be met. Designing sites takes a myriad of steps, then. Trial and error will be employed, no doubt, and A&B prototyping is a great resource for testing different site layouts.

People should also know that user experience (UX) is vital for the success of a site. If people don't enjoy using a site, then (frankly) it will fail. UX depends not only on the aesthetics of a site but also utility, accesibility, etc.

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience  (UX), put simply, is how a person feels about a site. UX design is based on usability, utility, design, accesibility and marketing. It is important that people have a positive UX, otherwise the site will underperform to its potential. The rewards of rendering a service won't be fully reaped if the site for customers isn't user friendly. Having a sleek user experience design can pump up the profitability and success of the company is done right, both through the six steps listed above and also through proper satistical/performance tracking.

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found the plethora of reading material kind of tedious. It's all interesting and useful, but it began to repeat itself after visiting a couple websites. I understand, though, that it's best to establish a firm foundation and explain the methodology behind site design before jumping feet first.

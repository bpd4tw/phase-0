##What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a blueprint that serves as a visual guide representing a site's skeletal framework. It's the bare bones design a developer uses when beginning a web project. It is usually completed in black and white and lays out the essential structures of a site (header, footer, pictures, navigaiton bars, search bars, etc.)

##What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing simplifies the process of site development and also establishes the foundation for building a web page.  It allows a developer to tinker with different design ideas while visually observing the effects certain techniques/forms have on a site.  Also, seperating the design portion of a site from the coding/development side ensures proper web page construction is taken one step at a time, thus avoiding conflict down the road.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did enjoy framing my site. It seemed somewhat bland at first, but as I progressed through the challenge, my imagination began to pick up. I went from merely seeing dull header boxes to imagining backgrounds and different text styles.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I ended up revising my wireframe quite a bit. After checking out some other examples of blogs and personal websites online, I realized how creative an endeavor site development really is.  It inspired me to jump back in and tinker with my own design.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
My biggest question was trying to figure out which wireframing software to use. There were so many thrown at us in one article that I struggled to even remember a couple of them and their unique attributes. I ended up settling on the wireframing site that Andrew Larson sent out through Slack, and it worked perfectly for this challenge.

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed creating and editing my wireframes. I also found it incredibly useful to look at other personal professional sites for inspiration. On the flipside, the supplemental reading in this challenge became a bit repepitive towards the end. Nothing wrong with that, but reading up on 20 different types of software packages for wireframing felt like a bit much.

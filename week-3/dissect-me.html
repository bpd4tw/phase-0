        After completing the challenges in this first week of Phase 0, I've come to recognize the importance of version control for developers. The ability to collaborate on a project in unison not only optimizes time spent working, but also fosters discussions and  modifications to create a better final project. Git "commits" provide invaluable "snapshots" throughout the course of a project's life.  As a result, workers can always jump back to a previous version of code for any reason (i.e. debugging).  Lastly, version control is a great tool for backing up work.  Because GitHub is a remote site, committed work will still be accessible even if the local file is lost.

          Let's delve a bit more into the git methods that keep track of changes: staging and committing.  When a file is "staged (through the command 'git add')," git recognizes the changes made to that work/code.  If a developer were to use the command "git status" in the command line, he/she would receive feedback regarding which files are ready to be committed and which files have been added (staged).

          Files are then committed through the command "git commit."  The code and its changes have now been saved as a "snapshot" in this project's timeline. This is one of the "major key" benefits git provides. If necessary, we can circle back and revise changes during a project's development.  To check on commits, use "git log" to view the recent commits on a local device.

          I've already touched on this some, but will repeat it one more time: Using GitHub to store code is useful for both collaboration and storage. GitHub has a large list of users and is a fantastic environment for sharing and working on code with other developers. It can be used as a place to network, a site for working in concert or even as a resource for learning/checking out new code.

          The storage component is vital, too.  As long as a user properly performs push/pull commands, he/she will always have two places where code exits:locally on an operating device and remotely on GitHub.  So, in case of a computer crash or random coffee spill, all tracks are covered and no code is lost.

##What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
We Used the <main>, <article> and <section> elements in our challenge. Most often, I find myself using the <nav> and <aside> elements because of their usefulness and specificity. Instead of sectioning off an area and creating a navigiation bar, I can simply use the HTML5 element.

##How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are laid out in a block like display on a page. HTML5 elements allowus to break up blocks into more user friendly designs. The order, then, is hierarchical. Whatever appears first (higher up in the text editor) takes precedent over the elements below. Headers are laid out in a decreasing hierarchical order as well: i.e. H1 appears before (and if emphasized more than) H2.

##What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned about snippets for the first time and how handy they are for saving code templates. I'm definitely going to utilize snippets, and can see how crucial they are for larger projects down the road.
In terms of sublime shortcuts, I've been trying to practice hot keys each night. I've figured out how to select multiple occurences of a certain word and then create cursors for each occurence. I'm also working on the other hotkeys used frequently, like copying lines or pasting in accordance with indentation.

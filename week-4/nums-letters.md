##What does puts do?
"Puts" is short for "puts string" and displays results while evaluating Ruby code. Puts add a newline to the end of the output after executing.

##What is an integer? What is a float?
Numbes without decimal points are integers. They are whole numbers that are not fractions. Numbers with decimal points are called floating-point numbers, aka floats.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Most programs only use integers, seeing as it would look funny having decimals for emails or songs.
Floats, though, are used for academic reasons more often and for 3D graphics. Money programs use integers because it matters how exact their result are.

```
puts 24*365

```
puts 60*24*365*10
5256000

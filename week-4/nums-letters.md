##What does puts do?
"Puts" is short for "puts string" and displays results while evaluating Ruby code. Puts add a newline to the end of the output after executing.

##What is an integer? What is a float?
Numbes without decimal points are integers. They are whole numbers that are not fractions. Numbers with decimal points are called floating-point numbers, aka floats.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Most programs only use integers, seeing as it would look funny having decimals for emails or songs.
Floats, though, are used for academic reasons more often and for 3D graphics. Money programs use integers because it matters how exact their result are.

puts 24*365

puts 60*24*365*10
5256000

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles these operations using +,-,* and /. When used on integers or floats, ruby will evaluate the operation you code.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are whole numbers not ending in a decimal. Floats, on the other hand, have decimal places. Integers are used more often in standard web application code, whereas floats are useful for fiscal code that needs to be precise.

##What is the difference between integer and float division?
The difference between integer and float is that they are no divisible by one another. In other words, I cannot divide an integer value by a float value. Either the integer must be changed using .to_f or the float changed using .to_i

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are objects in Ruby that manipulate bytes, i.e. characters. Simply, strings are objects in Ruby comprised of words and surrounded by quotes. You use them most often when displaying messages or text to explain something or to require some input from a code user.

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Variables are a memory location tool used by Ruby to hold data that will be called upon at some point in the code. You use variables to hold important information that you'll call often.  To call a variable, simply type the name. To assign a value to a variable, type the name, followed by an "=" and the value.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This was a solid challenge. It was a nice way to dip my toes back into Ruby. Maybe requiring us to look back at codeacademy would be a good idea in the future...Then again, nothing is stopping me from doing just that, so I'll jump on it myself!

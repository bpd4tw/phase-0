# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#For Person 4, I utilized the "delete_if" method. It's straightforward to use for hashes:iterate over the array using the method and decide what key/value you want to remove. An array is a bit different. You'll employ the "delete_if" method to start, but then you'll need to convert the array objects to strings so that you can use ".include?" to determine whether they CONTAIN the character/number you are looking to delete.
#When it comes to deciphering the Ruby docs, I did a command-f search to start. I tried to see if there were any method that matched exactly with the operation I was attempting to execute. If not matched, I went through the method index on the left hand side and checked out each method that seemed like a possible solution to my challenge problem.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?

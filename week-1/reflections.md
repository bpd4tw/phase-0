#Think About Time Reflection </h1>

1.)I first looked at "flow" as I check out the different time management materials.  I found out that "flow" is when a person becomes completely absorbed in an activity and activates the right hemisphere of their brain.  Emotions within the person are positive, energized and aligned with the task at hand.  It's synonymous with "being in the moment" or "in the zone" in the case of athletes.

I also watched the video "Forget big change, start with a tiny habit" by BJ Fogg.  In it, Fogg explains that motivation, contrary to popular belief,  is not the only factor that helps determine the formation of a new long term habit.  Instead, our ability to perform a task plays an equally large role in molding a new habit.  He proposes, then, that "planting a seed" (i.e. performing small tasks for an extended time period) is the most effective habit forming device.  He uncovered that performing a small task on a consistent basis after some other act, coupled with self exultation, will help to solidify a long term routine.

2.) Time Boxing is the act of setting a specific time parameter for working towards a goal.  When the allotted time has expired, those working on a project should step back and assess their progress.  This allows for useful self reflection and reflects the habit forming routine I discussed earlier.  In Phase 0, I will surely use time boxing when facing a difficult task.  Being able to break a project up into bite sized time blocks will allow me to slowly work towards my goal, all the while assessing my progress.  Plus, it'll keep me form getting burned out.

3.)Currently, my time management skills are so-so. Although I try to keep track of my time on tasks, sometimes it slips away from me.  I'm aware of time spent and attempt to break my day into hour chunks. I take a couple 30 minute breaks each day and throw a workout in every other day or so.  I check email frequently and then hunker down on work.

4.)My currently strategy works, but isn't always efficient. As I'm working, I'll monitor my time spent on a project but often fail to reflect on what has been accomplished or glossed over.  I become too worried about the end goal and let the work size intimidate my process.

 5.)Instead of hunkering down and trying to complete a task all at once (as I currently do), time boxing will allow me to take bite sized chunks out of future projects.  Also, habit formation through "planting seeds," as BJ Fogg discussed, is another tool I'll try to employ as I look to create more healthy and productive habits.  Doing something small everyday is not only doable but will also be beneficial for my long term success.

6.)My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is a balance of studying in this sphere and work on the side.  I plan on waking early every morning to get a jump start on emails/daily news/ etc. and then jumping into a bit on Phase 0 work.  In the mid afternoons, I'll be switching gears and doing some retail consulting work on the side.  However, I'm going to sincerely attempt to "time box" and review my work as I go.  Also, I'm going to do a bit of command line practice each morning in an effort to "plant a seed" and grow my skills in that area.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection </h2>

1.) A shell is an interactive user interface that takes commands through a keyboard and relays them to an operating system.  Back in the 1960's, shell was the only interface available for programmers to interact with Unix computers.  There was no monitor or graphical interface.  Instead, interaction with Unix relied upon a teletypewriter.  Also, there was no scrolling, copying or pasting, but multiple user interaction was possible/utilized.

Bash, then, is a Unix shell written by Brian Fox and released in 1989. It is a command processor that is loaded on a text window and takes commands from users through typing.  Through Bash, programmers can execute code using techniques such as piping, variables creation and control structures.  It also the default shell on Linux and OS X.  Lastly, employing Bash allows users to interact with their computers through commands on a text interface, departing from the more common graphical interface interaction.

2.) The most challenging part of going through this material was honing in on the minutiae of executing commands within the terminal.  One space "off" could completely throw off a command I was attempting to practice and throw me into a state of confusion.  I also had to adjust to the Unix structural design of branches and directories.  Lastly, it took me some time to really master the terminology that was put forth in the introductory webpage.  Getting used to employing a command called "cat" was a little strange at first.

3.) I was nearly able to use all of the commands.  I struggled with the "find" command and still have some questions regarding the "sudo" command.  Overall, though, it went well.  It was cool seeing how mastery of one command would cascade into utilizing the next.  Commands like "grep," piping and redirection all opened a whole new sphere of possibilities through use of the command line.

4.)That leads me into the discussion of what commands and arguments are the most important to know.  Obviously, the ground level commands of "cd," "cp," rm," "touch," "rmdir," and "mkdir" are vital to any action through the command line.  Yet, those can be picked up pretty easily through memorization.  It seems, then, that "grep," piping and redirection commands are most important due to the flexibility and creativity they can allow a programmer to use.  "Less" and "cat" are also useful for streaming a file for viewing...And I almost forgot "find," another vital command that finds lost files and, like "grep," and be paired with other commands for maximum utilization.

5.) pwd - print working directory. Essentially lets the user know where they are in the Unix system.

ls - list directory.  Shows all the contents within the current directory.

mv - move a file or directory.  Pretty much the same thing as changing the name.

cd - change directory.  Allows you to jump to different directories within the Unix system.

../ - to take a "step" back or upwards within the Unix tree.  If you want to exit a directory you're inside and jump to the parent directory, use ../

touch - create a blank (empty) new file.

mkdir - make a new directory

less - view the contents of a file one screen at a time.  A pager.  You can scroll forward or back using "/" or "?"

rmdir - remove directory

rm - delete.  If paired with "-r," it will delete a folder even with files inside.

help - also known as "man" on mac, it'll provide a description of a command you are wondering about and provide necessary information you may be searching for.

Truth be told, I had to search for "less" to find a better way to describe it.  I also looked up rm

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection </h3>

1.) To create a new repo, I would tell a person to log into their GitHub account, first.  Second, click the "+" sign next to their profile name and click "New Repository."  Next, name the repository, set it public or private and add a license.  Hit "create" and he/she is good to go.

To fork and clone a repository, first use the search bar at the top of your account home page to search the name of the repository you want to fork.  Click the correct search result, and then click "fork" in the upper right hand corner of the page and pick your profile.  Next, look towards the bottom right side of that same updated page and copy the URL link provided (this will allow us to clone the repository onto our local device).  Minimize this page and now enter your command line.  "CD" to the directory you want the repository to be stored in, and enter the command "git clone <url>."  After a second of uploading, you should have a successful fork established from that repository to your computer.

Forking a repository, as opposed to creating a new one, is useful for collaborating with other developers.  A new repository would simply be empty and is useful for the start of a project.  Forking, however, allows a developer to jump media res into a project that's already begun and contribute immediately.

2.)The only problems I came across setting up git and GitHub was just remembering commands in Terminal.  Remembering to use quotes around files names with spaces as you change into them is something I often forget.  Plus, the git commands can be pretty confusing at times, so I'm still trying to really hammer those home.

I learned how valuable git and GitHub are, though, when it comes to collaborating on a group project.  Now only is the simultaneous interaction crucial, but the snapshots of saved work provide a great safety net if anything ever needs debugging down the road.

1.)Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
https://github.com/bpd4tw/bpd4tw.github.io

2.)Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a new repository, a person should first log into GitHub and go to their home profile page.  In the top right, they should click the "+" and then click "new repository." From their, they should name it, make it public or private and add a liscense.  Then, to connect the repository to the local computer, the user should press "fork." Look at the lower side and the page and you'll see a url.  Copy the url and then, in the command line of the computer, type "git clone <url>" in whatever directory you would like your git connection to exist.  From here, you can work on a master branch and create your own local branches for doing work.

Describe what open source means.
This is software in which the original source code is made available to other developers and can be redistributed and modified.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source is a great tool, but it's important to use a license. Whichever one is appropriate for your project is the wisest decision.  It doesn't make me nervous, but it is crucial to be weary of who uses the code and does what with it.  On the flip side, it's hard to call anything a "utopia." Open Source is insanely valuable, though, and makes life much easier when collaborating on work.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
Similar to what I said above, licenses are crucial for the distribution and modification of a person's work.  Not only that, but they're important when it comes to having intellectual rights over a certain set of code.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I really solidified the creation of a repository and pull/push procedures during this challenge.  I did have an "aha" moment when working with some of the "git" commands on my command lines.  It was moreso "aha" in the sense that the commands were coming more naturally to me ("git branch -b" and "git commit -m") instead of having to constantly think of them in my mind and sort through their different uses.  I didn't struggle too much.  Just a couple mistypings here and there that hindered my progress, but nothing major.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Simply google searching useful git commands and looking up what exactly they do is the extent of my outside resource search.  I also found a great site for tips using Sublime - http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course--net-27293
